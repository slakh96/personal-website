                            I am a third year Computer Science Specialist and Statistics Minor student studying at the University of Toronto. So far in my studies, I have had the opportunity to take several computer science courses, including Software Design, Theory of Computation, as well as other programming courses. Through these courses I have learned many Object-Oriented Design techniques and algorithms â€“ such as Encapsulation, Recursive and Iterative algorithms and algorithm analysis. These skills have allowed me to build an Android application which contains a set of games.<br><br>
                            In my spare time, I have also built several side projects using a combination of skills that I have learnt on my own and from University. Some of these projects include this website which uses HTML, CSS, and jQuery, and a personal homepage which uses React and Redux in addition to the previously mentioned skills. Many of my other projects can be found on <a href="https://www.github.com/slakh96" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none">Github.</a><br><br>
                            
                            This summer, I worked as a software developer at <a href="https://www.rocscience.com/" target="_blank" style = "text-decoration: none">Rocscience</a>, where I implemented features to be used across several of the company softwares. I worked on both the front end and back end, and also helped to design the user interface. I currently work part-time as an Instructor at <a href="https://www.mathnasium.ca/auroraon" target="_blank" style = "text-decoration: none">Mathnasium</a>, where I teach math to students from grades 1-12 including Advanced Functions and AP Calculus.
                            <!--I am currently working as a Lead Instructor at Mathnasium, where I teach math to students from grades 1-12 including Advanced Functions and AP Calculus. My job requires me to explain difficult concepts to students while considering different learning styles and empathizing with the perspectives of the students in order to succeed. As a lead instructor, I am also expected to greet parents, manage breaks for students, assist other instructors, and answer queries from current and potential customers about centre operation and student progress. These duties have helped me to develop my communication and interpersonal skills.-->

                            Aside from coding, I love to go biking - exploring trails, landmarks, and communities around the Greater Toronto Area. I also do <a href="https://gurushots.com/sl.96/photos" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none">photography</a> and love reading sci-fi, as well as learning about cars.

                            Although I was only briefly introduced to computer programming in high school, I have since learned many programming languages and libraries since starting at the University of Toronto. I was surprised to discover the similarities between programming languages, and how one can transfer ideas and understanding of one programming language to learn another. I am practicing my skills constantly, both at school, work, and at home for my own projects. Below are the languages and libraries I have experience with.

                            My work experience has helped me to develop my technical aptitude, interpersonal skills, problem solving ability, and leadership skills. This summer, I worked at Rocscience as an intern, where I developed software and implemented features in the company software. My job required me to work on both the front and back end of the software, and to make important design decisions with the advice of senior developers and upper management. I learned how to work with a large and developed code base - learning how the code is designed and how different bits interact with each other, and using that knowledge to figure out how to extend and modify that code in order to implement new features is a departure from the skillset exercised in my personal and class projects, where I am involved in the development of all code. It's an enjoyable task, and I learned a lot! <br><br>
                            Below is a summary of my current and previous positions. <!--I am currently working as a Lead Instructor at Mathnasium, where I teach math to students from grades 1-12 including Advanced Functions and AP Calculus. My job requires me to explain difficult concepts to students while considering different learning styles and empathizing with the perspectives of the students in order to succeed. As a lead instructor, I am also expected to greet parents, manage breaks for students, assist other instructors, and provide answers to queries from current and potential customers about centre operation and student progress. These duties have helped me to develop my communication and interpersonal skills.--><br>

                            So far in my education, I have had the opportunity to take several computer science courses, involving both theory and practical applications. My favorite course so far in my education has been the Software Design course, where we learned tons of practical techniques on how to make our code more logical, clean, and structured while avoiding dependencies and duplicate code. We were also introduced to SOLID principles and design patterns, and were taught on how to incorporate these into our code. I believe that this course was the single most helpful course to me so far at U of T. Below are descriptions of several courses I have taken, or am taking this year at U of T. <br>
